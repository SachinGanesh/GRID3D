# GRID3D
GRID - 3D Model editor built using OpenGL and Simple DirectMedia Layer (SDL)

The aim of this project is to develop a 3-D graphics package which supports basic operations which include creating objects like cube, sphere, mesh, curves etc. and also transformation operations like translation, rotation, scale.

The objective is to build a 3D graphics editor having all required operations that a normal graphics editor should offer. The coding is implemented for a single canvas graphics editor. In this editor importance is given to a simple user interface and implementation of all basic graphic routines and basic graphic editing options. 

This is being my first project using an Open GL implementation. It was an effort to demonstrate the basic Open GL functions which will help the user to gain some knowledge about Computer Graphics. I hope this will be a stepping stone to my next such projects.
